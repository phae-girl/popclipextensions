PopClip Extensions
==================

PopClip is a nifty little utility by [Pilotmoon Software][1] for OS X that pops up a menu when you select some text, a lot like the copy menu on iOS. This is my collection of extensions that I've hacked together with bubblegum and duct tape. If you found this page accidentally and were looking for the actual PopClip Git page, [it's here][2].
